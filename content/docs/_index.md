## Creating new site pages

For this guide we'll work through a single example: creating a new documentation on Alto within CloudCannon, and ensuring it's shown in the correct place in your navigation bar.&nbsp;

Navigation in Alto is handled by front matter in Hugo, which can be easily edited in CloudCannon's <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Editor</a>.

```javascript
Code block
```

&nbsp;

<table><caption><p>This is caption</p></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Header</p></th><th><p>new table</p></th><th><p>new table</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Text</p></td><td><p>new table</p></td><td><p>new table</p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

**Each page on Alto has a 'Parent Section' property, which allows you to group related items in the sidebar. This sample site has a single Parent Sections, 'Customizing Alto'.**

You can also change the order of the page within the sidebar group using 'Weight'.
